## About The Project

Test-Driven Development is a big deal in the modern development landscape and, the main idea is simply that you start working on your code by writing automated tests before writing the code that is being tested. There are tons of benefits to working like this, all of which will be discussed in the resources below.

This is the sixth project in the Microverse Javascript course. It tested our knowledge
Objects, Object Constructors, Factory Functions, the Module Pattern, Classes,
ES6 notation, Webpack and using Jest for running tests. There are many
test-running systems available in JavaScript: Mocha, Jasmine, Tape, and Jest, etc.
However, this project is centered around using Jest.
